Write a Python program that reads a Loans CSV file and determines the top two most common loan reasons for each age range.
Use only built-in Python (csv module, sets, tuples).

Requirements:

Find all unique age ranges using a set.

For each age range, count how many times each loan reason appears.

Create a tuple for each age range in the form: (age_range, top_reason_1, top_reason_2).
